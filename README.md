# JAMA MediaApp
App used to view my movies and shows through the browser.

## Why I chose Golang
I chose Golang because it's probably the language I know best besides PHP. It has a lot of cool quirks about it, and I haven't done a good project with anything besides stuff I learned in school.

## To-do stuff
*Add a depth level to the function that grabs the media from the folders.
+ Style it to look better.
+ Add QOL features. Ex. Next/Previous Button
+ Implement a better video player than HTML5's
